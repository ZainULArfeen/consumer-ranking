Also went for the skillet brownie which was super yummy"

Amer Akhtar, 4 stars ,They have stagnated is one way of describing the current state if things. The menu hasn't changed much over the years but then in a way its a good thing too. Why fix what's not broken?
Shabeena Shah, 5 stars ,These nutella french toast were so delicious üòã do try them.
Zareesha Sheikh, 5 stars ,"This is Street 1 Cafe in Islamabad.
Ordered light stuff since it was super cold and didn't feel like having anything heavy for a day time meal.

We ordered Chicken with Cashewnuts with mashed potatoes sideline, Chicken Mushroom cannell, ‚Ä¶"
Naveed Latif, 4 stars ,"A rushy place in Kohsar Market Islamabad. If the weather permits, outside seating is recommended. Tried the Tom yum soup which was below average. Beef tataki was not as thinly sliced as it should have been. Salmon was a bit overcooked but tasty."
Mian Abdur Rehman, 4 stars ,"Had dinner and breakfast as well. Avoid steaks. Try Italian dishes, they were good. Breakfast all items were much better. Deserts were great too. Service is fast but a mixed hospitality from staff."
Z S, 5 stars ,Attractive ambience with good food taste. 09/10
Daniya Bint -e-Asif, 4 stars ,"I find the taste average of main course, but damn the dessert won my heart!!"
Anum Sadiq, 5 stars ,"Located in a prime location in Islamabad, F-6 Kauser market, this place offers some great food options. Dynamite prawns, cannelloni and hit me being personal favorite.

They have recently introduced a new dessert called pull me which is ‚Ä¶"
Mansoor Khalid, 5 stars ,Loved the taste of Belgian Chocolate and Coffee
Just A Food Lover, 2 stars ,Food is not as it should be as compared to their hefty prices. Mushroom cheese omelette was hard plus the bread was served cold and hard. And i can make better hashbrowns i swear. The stuffed French toast was literally stuffed with diabetes.. the only thing which was satisfying was the Belgium Waffles.. Not a good experience overall!!
Kamran Haneef, 5 stars ,This place offers great dine-in experience even during pandemic there were adequate precautions. Food is really good and maintains standard.
KBW 66, 3 stars ,"Street 1 Caf√© is located at perhaps the best eating spot in Islamabad; Kohsar Market. Great ambiance overall. It has been amongst the best, however, there is some deterioration in standards that I observed in the last 3 visits. The quality of cooking in no more that outstanding and some of the waiters need better training. The fried fish that I ordered smelled a bit and wasn't cooked that well. That was unlike Street 1 Caf√©. Despite all this, a great place to go."
Faizan Baig, 4 stars ,"Loved my visit to Steet 1 Cafe this time.
I went with 2 of my friends and we ordered Ribs from their winter menu, Khao Suey, Cream Mushroom Soup, Creme Brulee and Red King.

The Ribs were very juicy and fulfilling, it is more than enough for two people. It gets a little dry after chewing a bit and one should ask for a sauce with it.

Everything else was good value for money and very satisfying."
Zaeem Lutfi, 5 stars ,I simply love this place for ambience and food. Prices are reasonable. Bit crowded specially on weekends.
Mohammad Qamar, 4 stars ,"Had lunch on a whim at one of my favorite haunts from yesteryear. It still has a cozy, busy vibe to it. The outdoor seating is still in demand, and sidewalk traffic and hawkers from my memories were there as I remembered them to be. The level of service and food has dropped off though. TLDR: choose for the vibe, avoid for food."
rezaabbasy, 4 stars ,"I had the Mexican Omlette with Salsa and it was good. Weekends are always busy so I would suggest making reservations the day before.

They lose one star simply because when I called the restaurant to make the reservation on the phone two days before arriving, the guy on the phone was trying to avoid taking the reservation. Staff on the phone needs to be better trained"
Jeff Spicoli, 1 star ,"Just had to walk out of street cafe 1. We ordered two simple coffees and had to wait 25+ minutes without receiving them. We finally had to leave. What an absolute shame, we wanted so bad just to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. I‚Äôm so disappointed in our experience here. Frustrated. Shocked. This was horrible."
sabeera hussain, 5 stars ,Brilliant menu and nice outdoor seating area. Great place for brunch
Aamir Ali, 4 stars ,"Average environment. Average food quality.

Junaid Effendi, 5 stars ,"Had breakfast, it was great experience. Outdoor ambiance on top."
Khayam Abbasi, 5 stars ,"Never ever order Tum Kom Yo (Thai soup ü§Æ), do try their high Tea. Over all ambience is really good üëåüëåüëå"
Amer Zafar Durrani, 4 stars ,I keep saying but they don't listen; change your cutlery! It is horrible. Otherwise they are cool coffee place but need to improve the quality of their coffee as well.
Imran Khan khattak, 5 stars ,A great variety of beverages üëç
Dr Bubrak Amin Gandapur, 5 stars ,Delicious food with really good environment and ambience
Rai Arham Ehtisham, 5 stars ,Pricy but quality is top notch.
Rumail, 1 star ,"I visited on 23/12/20 and ordered the ""New Philly Steak Sandwich"". It tasted alright, however the next day I had severe food poisoning and vomited over 6 times. I tried to call them but no one picks up, they really need to improve their hygiene - absolutely HORRENDOUS. I spent full 2 days in bed recovering all due to that burger!"
Anoosh Zain, 5 stars ,"Delicious, fresh flavors. If you want to go to a place in Pakistan and gobble their salads - you know it‚Äôs truly amazing! Wish they were in Lahore."
Hira Dar, 3 stars ,"I used to love their steak and poached eggs. I don't know if the chef changed today or what but it was very different today. You can see that instead of spinach and cheese, the steak filling had mushrooms and jalepenos.
Not what I was expecting"
Vipul Modi, 4 stars ,"Very family friendly and a lovely place to come with the family for Sunday brunch. Highly recommend. Thank you for the good service.

Ordered brunch - orange juice with omelette, channa masala and paratha - it was delicious!"
Hassan Ur Rehman, 5 stars ,amazing breakfast menu with classy ambience
Affan Ashraf, 5 stars ,Went there for Sehri. Awesome experience. A mix of traditional desi food stuff and Unconventional food items. A wonderful place to sit and have a chit chat along. Small place but managed professionaly.

Brownie Skillet was too good.
Will be back definitely."
M.G. A, 4 stars ,Good n cool olace
Seher Mohsin, 5 stars ,"So I went to Street 1 expecting not much to be frank but I was blown away.
They have a really great breakfast.

I absolutely adored the shredded beef brisket! From the sauce to the egg and the beef. The beef was fantastic!

The omelette was so good we had it without any bread. The juices were also fresh and really balanced out the food.

I don't particularly like the biscotti but my friend really did so I'm just assuming that's a personal taste thing because everything else was great."
rash ra, 5 stars ,"Food is good, worth trying, serving is good for the price"
Abid Hussain, 3 stars ,"They have somewhat improved but their chicken mushroom cannelloni remains a constant disappointment. Very mediocre.
Service on Friday lunch hour was okay."
Aiman Saeed, 5 stars ,"Food quality is really good. Interior exterior is beautifully done. Staff is well trained.

Free appetizers are lovely. Their panini is really good and so are the burgers and chicken strips.

Also the wings and not to forget the lovely hit me cake"

Syed Suhaib Zia, 5 stars ,Amazing place to visit.
Usama Ibrahim, 5 stars ,Amazing dine in place. It's a bit expensive but food is so delicious. Lovely ambiance and people were of great service
Waqar Shah, 3 stars ,Very beautiful sitting area and the ambiance. Not much space for parking. They maintained and decorated the place quite well. Food is tasty but serving is quite small for the price they are charging. Service is a bit slow. They need to uplift in these two things as they are one of the best eating places in town.
Tajammal Ilyas, 5 stars ,Good menu selection. Good taste ...Nice ambiance
Vision Unlimited, 5 stars ,"The cafe is pure love. The food is amazing. The service is prompt and the overall feel and ambiance is very welcoming. Placed in a market known as Kohsar Market in F 6 sector of Islamabad, Pakistan, that has multiple caf√©s in one place. A must eat-at place for food lovers when in Islamabad"

Mian Umer, 4 stars ,"One of the must visit spots if your stopping by for breakfast at Islamabad ‚ù§Ô∏è
The variety of breakfast options just never ends. From Desi to Continental to English they have gotten it all covered for your tastebuds ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lavishly served and appealing to the eyes and the soul for people like me who love decor and presentation ‚ù§Ô∏è
We ordered
Philly steak mushroom omelette 9/10.
Stuffed chicken mushroom crepe 10/10.
Nutella french toasts 9/10
And extra sides of bread, butter and coffee.
A well fed start to the journey ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Sikander Azam, 4 stars ,"Ordered steaks, both T-bone and Tenderloin. T-bone was nice and juicy as expected. Tenderloin was also good, but the sauce was very bland. The main main issue was that the menu said seasonal vegetables, which just mean 10 French beans. They could have added Carrots, Cauliflower, Zucchini, Brocoli, or anything else one expects from a high end restaurant, but it was a disappointing. Mashed potatoes were quite bland as well, need to be cooked more and some seasoning or addition of herbs ( like paisley or oregano) could have added to the flavour. Fish was cooked nicely and not oily, but the quality of fish used was average. The music was all mixed up and did not follow a certain theme and did not add to the ambience. The interior of the restaurant does not follow a theme either. Seems like it was added from time to time. Furniture isn't bad, but tbe floor of the place is dated, quite dull and a big turn-off. Overall, it was OK. I would rate the place average, and food above average, but then staff good, as they were quite courteous and willing to listen and oblige."
hamad ul hassan, 3 stars ,Expensive. Taste not worth the money spent
The National Standard, 5 stars ,Excellent menu. Superb taste

Qasim Qayyum, 4 stars ,Good quality food. Nice environment to chill..specially open air...  Recommended.
Muhammad Laeeq Hassan, 4 stars ,"I have found their food and service level as one of the best in Islamabad. Due to current SOPs of dine-in in open areas, you may have to wait for the table a little though. This place is a bit pricy though as compared to other such entries in Islamabad. You can get 20% off, if you have a Faysal Bank card though (please do ask about this discount from restaurant before you are visiting as I availed it on the day of posting this review. It may be available afterwards)."
Safi Ghauri, 3 stars ,"Great location with average food
Its a safe place to come and enjoy. The ambience is great and they have lovely outdoor seating. The food is good but nothing that will blow your mind. Its a great place but just not worth the money"
Fahrettin Onuralp Mescigil, 4 stars ,One of the best places to spend time and eat a good food in Islamabad
Niaz Ahmad, 2 stars ,"Yesterday we had pepper steaks but was not upto the standard.
They need to improve or remove it from the Menu."
Godwin Austen, 1 star ,"Seriously the most overrated place in Islamabad. The food was below average, the place was noisy, and even the ambiance, that so many people rave about, was not that good, and the prices are off the charts for what you are getting. I don't know how they rack up so many positive reviews, but not worth it"
Amna Mariam, 3 stars ,This place is over priced and surely isn't for breakfast. Otherwise ambiance is on point!
Mehma Kunwar, 4 stars ,I absolutely loved the breakfast and the drinks except for cold coffee which wasn't nice and was extremely expensive.

They have a diverse variety in menu. The food is delicious!"
Asif Naseer, 4 stars ,Nice ambience. Welcomed by food basket. Ordered hi tea platter and tenderloin steak which arrived in 20 min. High tea platter was good. Cakes were fresh and delicious. Shaslik seemed a bit old. Steak was average and nothing special about it.

Breakfast and brunch both were available. Because I checked in at overlapping time. Special weekend desi breakfast is also available. I ordered Italian dishes. One was beaf and other was chicken and cold coffee. Complimentary starter bread was served with butter and olive oil. Food came on time. It was really delicious. Coffee was average.

Zohaib Bin Khalid, 5 stars ,"Another experience to street 1cafe and it didn't disappoint again. From the staff to the food quality, all were amazing. The quality of beef in steak tops was so good that it was able to cut down with a butter knife, wow. Other things ordered were Tom Yum Soup (they gave me in chicken even though it was not on the menu), stuff chicken strips, batter fries and chicken polo Romano. Every bite was ho die for.

Mr Khan, 5 stars ,"Probably my favourite evening/night chill out spot in Islamabad.

It's on a secluded street and away from the hustle and bustle of the main square.

Scenery is beautiful with an overshadowing tree lit with lanterns and outdoor fire heaters to keep you warm.

Menu is kinda expensive but you pay for what you get. Excellent quality food and drink as well as exceptional customer service.

It's a must if you visit Islamabad."

Zarihs Zoltan, 5 stars ,Street 1 is one of the state of the art restaurant of highest order in the capital city of islamabad. The environment is cozy inside and natural outside along with courteous staff. The restaurant offers wide variety of cuisine with selected but ultra delicious bakery items. Sunday brunch platter is finger licking with halwa puri and nehari whereas molten lava with ice-cream scoop is so yummy.
ÍπÄÏÉÅÏ§Ä, 5 stars ,"Food is really impressive & delicious. I tried mushroom soup, warm avocado & shrimp as an appitizer, and it was so good. I definately recommend this restaurant to others. Though the exterior looks a bit deteriorating, the interior looks fine and the service is also good."

Ammaad Farooq, 2 stars ,"[2013] Very good overall experience.  Ambience good. Food very tasty.  Food presentation is good. Staff is prompt.

[15/04/2018] The restaurant's standard seems to have dropped. The quality of the beef steak was below par. The Italian Chicken was average. Not an overall good experience. In my opinion, there are many other better options out there. This restaurant seems to be overly hyped."
Shoaib Khalil, 5 stars ,"I would rate it the best fine dinning restaurant in Islamabad.
Great service, courteous staff and good food.

Aadil Khalil, 5 stars ,Excellent food and place but on an upscale side!
A R, 2 stars ,"Air Conditioning issues inside. Tom Yum is not worth ordering. If you write Prawns then should not serve shrimps. Even the shrimps were not fresh and had a smell. The Spicy Thai salad is not spicy at all, but it does taste ok.

So in Summary ...... The dishes don't come out as advertised on the menu.

The ambiance is good."

Summiayah Farrukh, 5 stars ,Excellent food...never disappoints ...best sehri
Ismail Akram, 1 star ,Worst expüíî
Fahim Khan, 3 stars ,"Much on the higher end for the price. Stylish, chic and pompous. U have to have an attitude for being there to boast around later. Although not much different on the menu from others in the market, yet a place for chilling out! Good interiors, great ambience but a little congested. The place is infamous for the ill fated murder of Ex governor Punjab. However, the deceased liking for the place earned the restaurant repute of high end."
Changaiz Khan, 2 stars ,"Overrated, bland and over hyped. Used to be good but its become extremely commercialized, the food isn't what it used to be and id recommend going someplace that gives you more satisfaction for the money you spend. 5/10"

Atiq Massan, 3 stars ,"Had lunch there with friends. Food was cleanly presented with good quality ingredients, though it was not that ample in sizing, taste was just okayish. Location is top notch. We sat outside in open air. Sitting was a bit cramped but will do. The salad i ordered had to have some MORE olive oil. Oil used seemed as if not extra virgin olive. Quantity of some of ingridients was far less that other ingredients. Salt was not therre to compliment to the oils. My judgment of a restaurant comes from the knifes used and given for use to foodies. And theirs were not sharpened."
Nasir Ali Khan, 5 stars ,My favorite place these days. Lovely chicken mushroom soup. Good ambiance. Even had breakfast there a couple of Sundays. Try their eggs Benedict

Usman K, 4 stars ,This is a swanky upscale place with a nice ambience and lovely outdoor seating options in Kohsar market. The food is good through the flavors can be a bit unbalanced in some dishes. Service is also good though can't make up your mind from one trip only. Being upscale it is understandingly expensive. Well worth it if youre looking for a break from the standard chicken and beef options most eateries offer in Islamabad. Loved the avocado and caramelized walnuts quinoa salad. Would visit again to try out the other menu options.
