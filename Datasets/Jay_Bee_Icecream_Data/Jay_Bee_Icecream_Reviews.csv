Ali Haris, 4 stars ,Tried their white chocolate sundae and salted caramel sundae. The salted caramel was very nice and balanced but I couldn't really feel any special flavor from the white chocolate sundae
Rizwan Sohail, 4 stars ,Good place for a quick icecream. They have a good variety and prices are very low. Menu and actual pics are posted. Taste wise its also good.  Do try Alamgir Cone from Gulberg 2. Has a good diary taste to it
Ammad H. Qureshi, 5 stars ,You can't call me that much crazy about desserts but I crave about it I just want it to be something heavenly. I have tried and tested most of the local and international ice cream parlours available locally and would park JB's on top of all..
Umar Mushtaq, 5 stars ,Yummy! Talk about sweet sweet death! :) Diabetes has got nothing on me! The menu here makes all your worries melt away beautifully. The place is always jam packed and you have to wait for sometime for your order to be taken. The prices are ‚Ä¶
SALAHUD DIN, 4 stars ,"One of the best thing in the Town, very nice Start up.
Its fact Everything at the Start is good, but this is one of the best in Ice Cream, brownies and coffees.
Its only take away so recommended if u are in Car else its too pathetic to eat standing on the road.
Overall it is Good."
zohaib hassn, 4 stars ,"Must try Brownie ice cream, if you're having cold coffee Which is good pls mention them that do not keep it bitter instead keep it sweeter"
Farooq Masroor, 4 stars ,Top end!  Esp for the ridiculously affordable price.  Makes its next door neighbours feel a little shame for their exhorbitant rates!
shiraz chughtai, 5 stars ,Amazing. As a foreign visitor loved the variety of flavours available. Had the chocolate fudge special with chocolate and roasted almond topping. Was divine. 10/10
Shujah Muhammad, 3 stars ,"Prices are exceptionally low... But taste wise its very much average..
I tried hotcake with ice cream.. Cake was not soft.. I guess the quality can be improved.. But at such low pricesI guess it's the best u can get!"
Sayeeda Shah, 5 stars ,Just like cone ice cream we had when we were kids.thw cold coffee was good. And the same taste brought back nostalgia.
Rai Fareed, 5 stars ,A place which is widely famous for its ice cream and has a variety of options for every class
Omer T, 5 stars ,"Perhaps the best ice creams anf brownies in Lahore and that too on a very budget price. The consistency of their Vanilla ice cream is their trademark. While there are literally tens of ice cream parlours in its surroundings, Jay Bee's is definitely the best of them all and their most attractive offer is their low price. No seating though. Just order in your car n enjoy. Recommended!"

Well like everyone else I heard a lot about Jay Bee's and went to try it out.
So they are really doing good in managing a line of customers. They have priced their product competitive.
But they are not giving any WOW factor. Their speciality ice-cream with brownie was a typical thin can be bought from any other ice parlour.
They are good but not the worth the hype."

Jazak Allah ""Jay Bee's""

We see a lot of families are sitting there in cars and on side road n enjoying ice cream üç¶and coffee ‚òï.
