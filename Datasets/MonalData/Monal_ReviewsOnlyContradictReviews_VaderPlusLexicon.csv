Irtifa Irshad, 5 stars ,"No Doubt Monal is such a beautiful place in islamabad when you wish to eat with a perfect view , and their service is also on point , but the main problem is , it is so much expensive , like i ordered 1 breakfast platter which has 1 paratha , 2 puri , halwa , Alu bhujiya , Chanay , a season juice , coffee/Tea and a cheese omelette (cheese and Olive have bad taste) , and it cost me around 850rs , and its only for 1 person if you want to satiate your full hunger",Negative, 5 stars  Negative
