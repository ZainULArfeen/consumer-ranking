Irtifa Irshad, 5 stars ,"No Doubt Monal is such a beautiful place in islamabad when you wish to eat with a perfect view ,
and their service is also on point ,
but the main problem is , it is so much expensive , like i ordered 1 breakfast platter which has 1 paratha , 2 puri , halwa , Alu bhujiya , Chanay , a season juice , coffee/Tea and a cheese omelette (cheese and Olive have bad taste) , and it cost me around 850rs , and its only for 1 person if you want to satiate your full hunger",Negative, 5 stars  Negative

Hasan AlAgele, 5 stars ,"The restaurant only offers one thing and that is a view of Islamabad. The food is terrible, substandard and overpriced. You can get better pakistani food at roadside dhabbas. The worst are their platters, in which mostly leftover and stale food is served.
The washrooms are dirty. Parking is a mess
Not recommended at all,",Negative, 5 stars  Negative
