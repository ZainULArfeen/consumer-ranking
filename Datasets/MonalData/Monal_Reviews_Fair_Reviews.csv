MAHAR MUHAMMAD IBRAHIM, 5 stars ,"Its a must place to visit whether you are local or foreigner. The natural beauty of this place is mesmerizing. Whether you come in day or night, summer or winter you will never regret. The only bad thing is that road is dangerous because its on height and the turns are too sharp and moreover safety road barriers are not adequate and lights are also not sufficient. So be careful while driving. Try to come in day time. Try to bring warm clothes with you in summers as well because it gets colder at night. Bring your best phone and camera to capture the breathtaking views. The Monal Restaurant is construction in a unique way so that the visitors can enjoy the mesmerizing view while having food. I have visited the restaurant multiple times and still I didn’t get enough of this. I am just in love of this beautiful place . I would be delighted if i get invited to this place once again.",Positive

Fotomatic Studios Production, 5 stars ,"A very good place to have some food with ultimate quality and taste. Sitting on top of the Potohar, nestled against the pristine Margallas, and looking over the plains of Peshawar and Lahore, the brick and mortar of Islamabad may be modern, but its culture and traditions are embedded in the centuries of our history that have unfolded between the ranges of Khyber and Bolan and the valley of Mehran. And in many ways, The Monal – named after a pheasant of rare and exquisite beauty dwelling a little further north – epitomes this amalgam of the modern and the ancient. The resort is a touch of modernity set in pastoral idyll. Situated at a height of about 1173 meters above sea level, it is equipped with the latest facilities, but offers an ambience cultivated by heritage.",Positive

The Malik, 5 stars ,"On our short visit to Islamabad our friends took us to Monal. At first glance the magnitude of massive dining area mesmerise you and you completely discount long waiting time that otherwise you would never stand for. Word of advice always advance book your table which we skipped due to short and very unplanned visit. The venue and hill top view itself is a treat and anything that pleases your taste buds after that is a bonus. Having said that they did not disappoint us with the standard of food they serve. Top rating for their mixed grill platter, lamb korma, chicken karahi and few other delicacies won our heart as well.  I’m all in to visit Monal again but this time I’m defiantly going to book a table in advance... lesson learnt   Subjection : they should start online booking facility to simplify the process. Also include car registration for parking allotment while booking online.",Positive
Ruttie Jinnah, 4 stars ,"The location is just beautiful. Ambiance is also good. But the place getting over crowded. Moreover, the taste is just pathetic. I doubt if they serve fresh food. Moreover the prices are too high. They are around 250% high with compromised taste.. the 17% GST is not inclusive in the prices. The staff is also not cooperative. However, if you want to pay like you are having your meal at a 5 star hotel, with the staff behaviour like a 1 star. You can visit there for food. If you only want to visit the place, that is a good choice because the view from the restaurant is just breathtakingly beautiful.",Positive

Malik Brothers, 3 stars ,There is no denial that The Monal is one of the best places in Pakistan. It is located on one of the most beautiful sights in Islamabad. Pir Suhava is the best place for a get out trip. The weather at Monal is best for having a dinner or even a lunch. You can see the entire islamabad from there. The taste of the food is great. Not too spicy. Ambiance is also good. Music is also good. Live.  You can go & check out. It is a must.,Positive

Adeel gee25, 1 star ,The service is poor we ordered single salted lassi and were served sweet lassi twice. And we had to pay for three glass whereas we ordered only one. The waiters were also rude.

Kids Are our Future, 5 stars ,One word for this place AWESOME. I was astonished by the beauty which is surrounding this place. MONAL is like the top view point of the heavenly Margala hills and Islamabad. The while trip from the bottom of hills till the top for Monal is breathtaken and worth experiencing. The food at Monal is soo delicious that I had to lick my fingers. We ordered prawns and tikka platter to enjoy the hot food with cold breeze.  They also serve hot tea which acted as a cherry on top at the hill top. If you are in islamabad and looking for an adventurous food then Monal is your recommended destination.,Positive
