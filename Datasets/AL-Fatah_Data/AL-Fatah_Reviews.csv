And upon inquiry all respondents on call were trying to blame the driver who wasn't given that item. Upon my request to  give me number of branch owners or manager they  managed a fake GM named
Nadeem who was also kinda integrity failure . In a nutshell it is not about little thing . It's about honesty and the level of fraud one can do in his capacity. This time they could do this only and next time they would do big if given a  chance"

Abdul Munem Khan, 4 stars ,"Al-Fatah is located on the first floor of the Centairus Mall in Islamabad. It is a departmental store. The largest department is of groceries. Next largest is of crockeries and cutleries. However, one can find clothings, make up items, toys, bags and suit cases, electronics items, watches, etc etc in this store.
Majority of their items are imported items, so those are quite expensive.
If you go early in this store and check out before 11 am, you can get up to 10 percent discount."

The mall also has a whatsapp account for online delivery. Ordered stuff about a week ago and still not received yet. I already got my stuff delivered from a far flung city. But their service is too poor to deliver on time.

Update: I finally received my package. One of the items is not what I ordered. Now I have to pay to return the package so they send me back the correct order. Absolutely level of incompetence!"

Asadullah Ahmad, 3 stars ,"This review is only for their online delivery service. My experience with their actual store in Centaurus has been good.

Before even ordering anything, I had called them and asked to confirm about bank transfer or card payment option. They told me they have mobile POS machines and it won't be an issue. In order notes I also mentioned clearly that I want to pay only via card or advance bank transfer. Then during confirmation call when they told me 3 items were missing, I again confirmed and reminded them that I have to pay with my card so they send MPOS machine or ask me to deposit in advance.

When the delivery guys came, however, they didn't have the MPOS and asked for cash. After explaining and discussing, thankfully one of them agreed that I transfer to his Easypaisa account so they didn't have to take the delivery back. Funnily enough, I have just now noticed that on the back of the receipt they even wrote ""Payment has to be made with debit card. Take the machine with you"".

On top of this issue, I won't recommend their fresh fruit delivery. I don't know if the fruits were severely damaged during transport or they picked really damaged ones in their store, but quite a few guava/amrood were mushed and squished, while most bananas in bottom row were either split open or were leaking as can be seen in picture. A few other items that were in my order were also missing when I wasn't informed about their unavailability on phone. But I was only charged for the items that were delivered to me."

rashid ali tamoor, 3 stars ,Al-Fatah store was in my to visit list as listen many times for their quality items. It was well presented everything from the cutlery grocery electronics to other household items. But the price was far higher compared to the original price of items. On asking why the price is so high they could not make it clear. The store area should be larger as per its capacity. And cash counter was also not enough. Al-Fatah should focus on pricing as it is not suitable for a supermarket to overcharge its customers.
